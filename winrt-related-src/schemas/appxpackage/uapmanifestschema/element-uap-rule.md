## Attributes and elements

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Data type | Required | Default value |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| **Type** | A string that specifies whether the rule is an inclusion or exclusion rule. | A string that can have one of the following values: *include* or *exclude*. | Yes |  |
| **Match** | The IRI to use in the rule. See RFC 3987: Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) for details. It is unique per application in the package and is case sensitive. For example, values of *Match* can be: `https://www.microsoft.com/`, or `*.pdf`. | A string with a value between 1 and 2084 characters in length. | Yes |  |
| **WindowsRuntimeAccess** | Declares UWP (Windows Runtime) access from remote sites. This attribute gives control to a developer to specify the set of URIs that can access UWP APIs from their website. This attribute is not allowed if *Type* is set to `exclude`. | An optional string that can have one of the following values: *allowForWebOnly* (Indicates that only UWP APIs created by the developer and included inside the app package will be exposed.), *all* (Indicates that all allowed UWP APIs will be available.), or *none* (Explicitly states that no UWP APIs will be exposed.). | No | *none* |
| **uap5:ServiceWorker** | This represents the registration of a service worker from a web page (a Progressive Web App) to run as a UWP app. If true, it will be determined whether a URL the app navigates to has the permission required to register the app as a service worker. | An optional boolean value. | No |  |

> [!NOTE]
> The UWP Windows Runtime class you intend to expose to JavaScript code must be decorated with the *AllowForWeb* attribute where it is declared.

### Child elements

None.

### Parent elements

| Parent element | Description |
|-|-|
| [uap:ApplicationContentUriRules](element-uap-applicationcontenturirules.md) | Specifies which pages in the web context have access to the system's geolocation devices (if the app has permission to access this capability) and access to the clipboard. |

## Remarks

If more than one rule is defined, then the order of the rules is important.

To define the **Match** attribute with an IRI for a web resource, you can specify only secure `https:` sites - unsecure "http:" sites aren't allowed. If you specify a `http:` site, you get a schema semantic check validation error.

For any values that have a [scheme](/windows/uwp/launch-resume/launch-maps-app) in Windows 8.1 (version 6.3.0), the manifest only permits secure `https:` scheme. The manifest fails any other scheme. This rule doesn't apply on Windows 8 apps for backward compatibility.

## Requirements

| Minimum OS Version | Windows 10 version 1511 (Build 10586) |
