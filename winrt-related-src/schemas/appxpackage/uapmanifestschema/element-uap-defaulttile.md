## Attributes and elements

### Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Data type | Required | Default value |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| **ShortName** | A short name for the app that is displayed directly on the tile. This string is localizable; for more info, see Remarks. | An optional string with a value between 1 and 40 characters in length. | No |  |
| **Wide310x150Logo** | The 310x150 wide version of the logo image. This image is displayed when the tile is displayed in its wide format. If this image is not provided, the tile can only display in the square format and can't accept notifications based on [wide template types](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh761491(v=win.10)). The user has the ultimate choice as to which format the tile uses, so it is a best practice to include a wide logo image. If a wide logo image is provided, the tile will be shown initially in its wide format. For more info about required logo dimensions, see [Tile sizes](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh781198(v=win.10)). | An optional string with a value between 1 and 256 characters in length that ends with `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg` that cannot contain these characters: `<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `|`, `?`, or `*`.

| **Square310x310Logo** | The 310x310 square version of the logo image. | An optional string with a value between 1 and 256 characters in length that ends with `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg` that cannot contain these characters: `<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `|`, `?`, or `*`. Additionally, the `/` and `\` characters cannot be the first or last characters. Also, the string can contain `/` or `\` but not both. | No |  |
| **Square71x71Logo** | The 71x71 square version of the logo image. | An optional string with a value between 1 and 256 characters in length that ends with `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg` that cannot contain these characters: `<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `|`, `?`, or `*`.

## Remarks

For the **Wide310x150Logo**, **Square310x310Logo**, **Square71x71Logo**, and **Tall150x310Logo** images, you can supply images of different scales so that Windows can choose the best size for the device and screen resolution. You can also supply high contrast images for accessibility and localized images to match different UI languages. This feature also allows you to localize the **ShortName** attribute. For more info, see the [Globalization](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh831183(v=win.10)) topic.
