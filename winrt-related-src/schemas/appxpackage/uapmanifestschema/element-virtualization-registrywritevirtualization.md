# virtualization:RegistryWriteVirtualization

Indicates whether virtualization for the registry for your package. If disabled, other apps can read or write the same registry entries as your package.

> [!NOTE]
> This element requires the  **unvirtualizedResources** [restricted capability](/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#restricted-capabilities).

## Element hierarchy

[\<Package\>](element-package.md)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[\<Properties\>](element-properties.md)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**\<virtualization:RegistryWriteVirtualization\>**

## Syntax

``` xml
<virtualization:RegistryWriteVirtualization>

    <!-- Child elements -->
    virtualization:ExcludedKeys

</virtualization:RegistryWriteVirtualization>
```

## Attributes and elements

### Attributes

None.

### Child elements

| Child element | Description |
|-|-|
| [virtualization:ExcludedKeys](element-virtualization-excludedkeys.md) | Specifies the list of keys that are excluded from registry virtualization. |

### Parent elements

| Parent element | Description |
|-|-|
| [Properties](element-properties.md) | Defines additional metadata about the package including attributes that describe how the package appears to users. |

## Remarks

This element requires the **unvirtualizedResources** [restricted capability](/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#restricted-capabilities).

You can only declare registry locations under the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` to be excluded from virtualization. This schema and syntax were introduced in the Windows 10, version 2004. Previously, in the Windows 10, version 1903 release, similar functionality was introduced with the [desktop6:RegistryWriteVirtualization](element-desktop6-registrywritevirtualization.md) element. If an application includes both syntaxes for disabling file system virtualization, the old declaration will be used on pre-2004 OS versions while the new declaration will be used on 2004 and later OS versions.

## Requirements

| Item | Value |
|--|--|
| virtualization | `http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/virtualization/windows10` |
| **Minimum OS Version** | Windows 10 (Build 20348) |
